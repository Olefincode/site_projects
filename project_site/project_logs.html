            <p>Project scope and deliverables were reviewed with the mentor. Market research on CO₂ and methanol applications was conducted by Linh and Sophia to assess economic relevance. Research on CO₂ hydrogenation for methanol synthesis was also performed, leading to the selection of Cu/ZnO/Al₂O₃ as the catalyst due to its industrial use and strong literature support. A Python model using <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b01323">Jean-François et al.</a> kinetics under ideal gas assumptions was developed, but results diverged from literature trends due to high-pressure operating conditions (10-60 bar) where ideal gas behavior is no longer valid. As a result, ASPEN HYSYS modeling was identified as necessary to account for non-ideal gas effects and ensure accuracy.</p>

            <p>An update on project progress was presented to mentor, and project proposal was finalized to establish and confirm the direction of the methanol production pathway, which will involve a synthesis step followed by separation to achieve a 70 mass% crude methanol mixture, whereupon the treated feed will be sent to a central processing facility. Extensive and rigorous market research and expected pricing analyses were performed by Sophia and Linh to determine the economic and market feasibility of a green methanol process and to ascertain a target production cost necessary to ensure market competitiveness. Tentative deadlines were also proposed and determined by Sophia and Linh.

                <p>Case studies iterating through reactor operating conditions (temperature: 200–300 °C, pressure: 1 × 10³–2 × 10⁴ kPa) and reactor lengths (2–14 m), while monitoring outlet CO, CO₂, and MeOH molar flows and compositions, were performed to determine optimal reactor conditions. To meet modular specifications, a reactor length of 8.75 m operating at a temperature of 200 °C and a pressure of 2.00 × 10⁴ kPa was selected to achieve maximum MeOH selectivity (low CO content in the outlet flow) while maximizing CO₂ conversion. A separation system was developed using phase separation to remove H₂ gas from the mixture, followed by distillation to achieve a 99.5 mol% MeOH product, utilizing a distillation tower with 40 trays, a reboiler pressure of 120 kPa, and a condenser pressure of 101.3 kPa -- resulting in a pressure drop of .4675 kPa per tray. Prior to the update presentation, the distillation tower design must be further refined to deliver a separation system that meets modular specifications while purifying the reactor effluent to a 70 mass% methanol product.</p>
